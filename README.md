# Piscre
Mini project implementing Raspberry Pi Zero WH with Waveshare 7.5inch (HD) screen.
Obviously done in many other places but I wanted to do it myself.
Every other repo I saw had shit all, way overcomplicated it, or no longer worked.

Steps
0) Hardware setup (YouTube this or something), stick screen in photo frame.
1) Run installation script
2) Install other stuff I forgot
3) Get API keys (all free) for
3a) OpenWeather API
3b) CoinMarkertCap
3c) News API
3d) Twitter
4) Run with "python3 drawer.py"
